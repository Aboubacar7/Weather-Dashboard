# Weather-Dashboard

A weather dashboard with form inputs
I can search for a city
Current and future conditions for that city are presented
City is added to the search history
I can view current weather conditions for that city
I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
